# MIMIC-III Visualizations and Risk Factors Extraction

This repository contains a collection of advanced data visualizations and data extraction scripts built using the MIMIC-III Demo database. The project demonstrates several analyses on electronic health record (EHR) data, including patient outcomes, diagnosis co-occurrence, lab trends, polypharmacy, and post-surgical infection impacts. Interactive components (using D3.js) are provided via an HTML file and JSON data.

## Project Overview

The project includes two main components:

1. **MIMIC Visualizations (`mimic_visualizations.py`):**  
   Generates five distinct visualizations:
   - **Age vs. ICU LOS by Outcome (Faceted by Gender):**  
     *Hypothesis:* Older patients may experience longer ICU stays and different outcomes.  

   - **Diagnosis Co-Occurrence Network for the Top 10 Diagnoses:**  
     *Hypothesis:*Certain diagnoses frequently co-occur, indicating common comorbidities.  
     
   - **Key Lab Trends Before ICU Admission (Survivors vs. Non-Survivors):**  
     *Hypothesis:* Lab value trends before ICU admission differ between survivors and non-survivors.  
     
   - **Polypharmacy vs. Age Bubble Chart:**  
     *Hypothesis:* The number of medications (polypharmacy) is associated with patient age and may influence hospital stay. 
     
   - **Post-Surgical Infections and Their Impact on ICU LOS:**  
     *Hypothesis:* Some surgical procedures have a higher infection impact on LOS, reflected in both LOS differences and patient counts.

2. **Risk Factors Extraction (`risk_factors_extraction.py`):**  
   Dynamically extracts the top 20 diagnoses, maps them to human-readable labels, aggregates patient data (including age groups and survival status), and outputs the top 6 risk factors in a JSON file.

Additionally, a **Health Risk Radar Chart** is provided as an interactive HTML file (`radar_chart.html`), with a screenshot (`Health Risk Radar Chart.png`) demonstrating its appearance.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Dependencies:**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn networkx```
    (D3.js is used for the interactive HTML; no Python dependency is needed for it.)

2. **Database Setup:**  
    Place the mimic_demo.db SQLite file in the root folder of the repository. (Note: The MIMIC database cannot be shared publicly for privacy reasons. Please request access at www.citiprogram.org.)

3. **Running the Scripts:**
    Execute the visualization script:
   ```bash
    python mimic_visualizations.py```
    and the risk factors extraction script:
   ```bash
    python risk_factors_extraction.py```

4. **Interactive Components:**
    The interactive radar chart is contained in radar_chart.html and uses D3.js. You can view it directly in a web browser or host it via GitHub Pages for a dynamic experience.

## Initial Key Findings
**Age vs. ICU LOS by Outcome:**
Older patients tend to have shorter ICU stays, potentially due to earlier palliative care interventions.
Survivors generally stay longer than non-survivors, with younger patients showing high variability in ICU stay.

**Diagnosis Co-Occurrence Network:**
Hypertension, Atrial Fibrillation, and Congestive Heart Failure are the most frequently co-occurring conditions, indicating common cardiovascular disease clusters.
Acute kidney failure is strongly linked to sepsis, highlighting its role in multi-organ dysfunction.

**Key Lab Trends Before ICU Admission:**
Non-survivors show sharp declines in WBC and RBC levels, suggesting immunosuppression or late-stage sepsis.
Elevated ferritin and fibrinogen levels in non-survivors suggest ongoing systemic inflammation.

**Polypharmacy vs. Age:**
Older patients, especially those in emergency admissions, take more medicationsâ€”a marker for higher chronic disease burden.
Higher medication counts are correlated with longer hospital stays.

**Post-Surgical Infections:**
Procedures like percutaneous abdominal drainage and IV feeding exhibit significantly higher infection-related ICU stays.
Some procedures, such as coronary artery catheterization, have lower infection risks, suggesting differences in procedural infection susceptibility.

**Health Risk Radar Chart:**
Men exhibit higher risks for conditions such as hypertension and underactive thyroid, whereas women show increased risks for congestive heart failure and acute kidney failure in the 90+ age group.
Type 2 diabetes is a common risk factor across both genders, underscoring the importance of early metabolic control.
